            <h1>Refund, Cancellation & Re-scheduling Policy</h1>
            <p class="mt-3">
                In case of no-show or unutilized bookings, the User shall be required to make requests for any valid and applicable refunds, as per the Vendors’ policies, or within 15 days from the travel date (whichever is earlier). No refund would be payable for any requests made after the expiry of 30 days of travel date/check-in as aforementioned and all unclaimed amounts for such no-show or unutilized bookings shall accordingly be deemed to have been forfeited.
            </p>
    
            <p class="mt-3">
                The refund shall be processed within 15-20 working days from the date of the cancellation request, after receiving back-to-back refunds from the concerned Vendor. Payment will be refunded back into the same original payment instrument like the same credit card or bank account from which it was paid for the traveler. In the case of Travel Agents (B2B Booking), refund recharge or upload of any type is always credited to their agent's Trip Inventor account balance. In case of an agent's account closure, the agent is supposed to consume its balance or clear their dues (if any). No money transfer will be done to the travel agent's bank account, in any circumstances.
            </p>
    
            <p class="mt-3">
                In case the User avails to book any of the Services offered by the Vendor and is, thereafter, not contactable on the contact details provided, then the tour/travel reservation selected by the User will stand canceled and Trip Inventor   or the Vendor will not be liable for any charges/expenses incurred by User, either directly or indirectly in this regard
            </p>
    
            <p class="mt-3">
                Any Refund Claims arising due to cancellation/delay of flight by the Vendor shall be subject to Trip Inventor receiving the refund from the Vendor. In the event the Vendor does not refund the amount to the Trip Inventor, the Trip Inventor   shall not be held liable for the same
            </p>
    
            <p class="mt-3">
                The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                Cancellation/Re-schedule of Flight Tickets up to 24 hours will be dealt with by Trip Inventor. In less than 24 hours, the USER should cancel it directly with the airline and inform Trip Inventor   for the refund processing.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                Trip Inventor shall charge cancellation fees - varying from time to time and transaction to transaction and type of service. This fee will be over and above the Airlines Cancellation Fees. Similarly for other services like Bus Tickets etc, Trip Inventor   will add its cancellation fees over the Vendor's cancellation Fees
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                The cancellation Policy is defined and governed by the Vendor and Trip Inventor will not be able to make any changes around it. Refund will only be processed once the USER informs Trip Inventor .
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                Partial Cancellation may or may not be allowed - This will depend on the Vendor's Cancellation Policy.
            </p>
            
            <p class="mt-3">
                Re-scheduling of Services (E.g. Date Change in Flights) will incur Fare Difference, Airlines Re-schedule/Penalty Charges, and Trip Inventor Re-schedule Charges
            </p>
    
            <p class="mt-3">
                Domestic and International Booking/Cancellation/Re-schedule will have different amount of fees for different Services
            </p>
    
            <p class="mt-3">
                Name Change, Title Change, Age Change, Sector Change, etc is generally not allowed by Vendors - Any such changes or more (not covered here) will not be entertained by Trip Inventor. The User needs to work directly with the Vendor and Trip Inventor will not be responsible/liable in any form
            </p>
    
            <p class="mt-3">
                Once a confirmed ticket/service is booked/generated, Convenience Fees are not refundable under any circumstances. If you are booking a special discounted return fare then both sectors have to be cancelled together
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                The USER will be solely responsible for the Visa, Passport, or any other requirement for the travel. Trip Inventor   will not be responsible for any inadequacy of any form
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                Check the Baggage Allowance – Cabin and Check-in – No Free Baggage Allowance for Infants. Meals, Seats, and Special Requests are not guaranteed. USER needs to check this with the Vendor directly.
            </p>
    
            <h3 class="mt-3">Booking Confirmation</h3>
            <p class="mt-3">
                User should not take any action based on information on the Marketplace until User has received a confirmation of User’s transaction. In case of confirmations to be received by email, if User does not receive any confirmation of User’s purchase/transaction within the stipulated period, User may first look into the "spam" or "junk" folder to verify that it has not been misdirected, and if still not found, please contact Trip Inventor's call center or login into the User Account section of Trip Inventor.
            </p>
    
            <p class="mt-3">
                In case a booking confirmation e-mail or SMS gets delayed or fails because of technical reasons or as a result of incorrect e-mail ID/phone number provided by the user etc, a ticket will be considered 'booked' as long as the ticket shows up on the confirmation page or in the User Account section of Trip Inventor.
            </p>
    
            <p class="mt-3">
                The total price payable will be displayed to the User before making payment to the Vendor. Users are hereby informed that in case of a booking request being rejected by a Vendor (i.e. not confirmed by the applicable Vendor), any amounts collected by Trip Inventor for such booking will be refunded to the User’s Account used for making the payments.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                Offer Fares / Series Fares / Group Fare or any other similar fares are non-refundable, and non-changeable under any circumstances. In these types of bookings, more than one (non-related) passenger is added to the same pre-purchased PNR. Names in this type of fare are updated between 8 pm and 11 pm, one night before the travel date. Hence, web check-in needs to be done by the passenger or the travel agency once the names are updated. Do note airline counters are not very friendly at some airports and machines may / may not operate. Also, airlines may levy service charges for issuing boarding passes from the airport counter. Since these are collective passenger’s tickets, normal web check-in, meal selection, extra baggage purchase, wheelchair addition, GST or any other special services cannot be added to these tickets. Lastly in these types of fares, our fare rules supersede airlines and hence no refund requests are entertained unless the flight is cancelled or the flight date/timing is changed by more than 6 hours in domestic flights and over 24 hours in international flights.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                Name changes (minor or major) in any form cannot be done in these fares. In this type of fare (Offer Fares / Series Fares / Group Fare or any other similar fares), you are not supposed to contact airlines directly or any other body for any reason. Trip Inventor should be your only point of contact for any purpose and the decision of Trip Inventor will be final. In case you contact airlines or any other body, your account might be disabled and your balance will be forfeited.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                In case of a schedule change and airlines provide multiple options, the agent/customer has the choice to choose among the given options only within the given time. However, once names are updated in the revised itinerary, thereafter no changes will be accepted of any type. Also note if the agent/customer does not respond in the given time then the Airlines / Trip Inventor can choose any option.
            </p>

                Offline Booking
            </h3>
            <p class="mt-3">
                Trip Inventor avoids and does not recommend travel agents for doing offline booking with us. However, if the travel agents insist, Trip Inventor can make the booking on behalf of the travel agent as a courtesy. Having said that Trip Inventor will not be responsible for any type of mistake like date, origin city, destination city, itinerary details, pricing, name & details of the passenger, etc. Travel Agent will be responsible for any mistake or issue in offline booking from Trip Inventor. Trip Inventor in any circumstances will not bear any expense or refund any part of the booking amount.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-3">Promo Codes            </h3>
            <p class="mt-3">
                Trip Inventor may generate promotion codes from time to time which may be availed on the site for discount, if applicable. Trip Inventor at its discretion, could add new promo codes, or change or withdraw existing ones without any prior notice. In case of any dispute with any party, Trip Inventor's decision will be binding and final.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                When USER registers with Trip Inventor, Trip Inventor or any of its partners/affiliate/group companies/partners/vendors may contact User from time to time to provide information/offers of services that Trip Inventor or such other group companies believe may benefit User.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-3">User Responsibility & Liability </h3>
            <p class="mt-3">
                User shall be responsible for their actions in utilizing the Services purchased by User, and Trip Inventor shall not be liable for any such action. Trip Inventor is only providing a platform for communication and it is agreed that the contract for Service shall be a strictly bipartite contract between the Vendor and User.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                User represents that User is of legal age to form a binding contract with Trip Inventor and is not a person barred from receiving Services under the laws as applicable in India.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                Any references to a Vendor being "verified" (or similar language) only indicate that the Vendor has completed a reasonable verification process. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification, or guarantee by Trip Inventor about any Vendor, including of the Vendor's identity and credibility. Trip Inventor therefore recommends that you always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to avail services from a Vendor or while having any other interaction with them.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                Upon receiving the User’s complaint, Trip Inventor shall inform the relevant Vendor of such complaint and request for an explanation. Users are required to refrain from raising frivolous and baseless complaints. User expressly acknowledges that the Vendor providing the deficient Service will be solely responsible to User for any claims that User may have about such defective service and Trip Inventor shall not in any manner be held liable for the same.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                Unless due to User’s negligence, in the event the Vendor fails to complete a delivery of any Service, User acknowledges that the Vendor will be liable to make any applicable refunds or payments. User agrees that Trip Inventor will not be held liable for the failure of the Vendor to make available any Service therein.
            </p>
    
            <p class="mt-3"> 
                Trip Inventor reserves the right at all times to disclose any information as is necessary to satisfy or comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, or to edit, refuse to post, or remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, in Trip Inventor's sole discretion.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                In no event shall Trip Inventor its officers, directors, employees, partners or vendors be liable to User, the Vendor, or any third party for any special, incidental, indirect, consequential, or punitive damages whatsoever, including those resulting from loss of use, data or profits, whether or not foreseeable or whether or not Trip Inventor has been advised of the possibility of such damages, or based on any theory of liability, including breach of contract or warranty, negligence or other tortuous action, or any other claim arising out of or in connection with User’s purchase of the services herein.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                Trip Inventor shall not assume any liability for the non-availability of the Services where required or any action or inaction that might be taken by the Vendor.
